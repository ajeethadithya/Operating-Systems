                                                                 PA1 Additional Questions:

1.What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? 
  Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

A) EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULER:

	Advantages:
	-> This scheduler selects processes based on the generated random number, and hence each process get a chance to get scheduled due to the randomness.
	-> Since the random number generator is based on exponential distribution, we can manipulate the lambda value and control which range of process
           priorities get more chance of getting selected.	
	-> The scheduling avoids starvation of processes.

	Disadvantages:
	->Not all processes get equal treatment because of the exponential distribution. Hence choosing a good lambda value is important.
	
B) LINUX-LIKE SCHEDULER::

	Advantages:
	-> The CPU time of each process is monitored and priority is assigned accordingly for the next epoch. This promotes fairness among processes.
	-Starvation is avoided by providing quantum for each process in every epoch.

	Disadvantages:
	-> Linux-like Scheduler is very complex compared to the other two schedulers. Scheduling time becomes very large as number of processes increases.

C) XINU SCHEDULER:

	Advantages:	
	-> It is a very simple and fast scheduler, as very little computation is required to select the processes which need to be scheduled next.

	Disadvantages:
	-> Processes which have low priority might have to wait for a long time before they are given CPU time.
	-> Starvation is a possibility with this scheduler, as high priority processes are always executed first.

2. Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

A) EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULER:

	NULL process is allowed to execute when the ready queue is empty.

B) LINUX LIKE SCHEDULER:

	NULL process is allowed to execute when the ready queue is empty.

C) XINU SCHEDULER:

	Xinu Scheduler does not schedule NULL process.
